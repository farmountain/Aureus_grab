# Aureus-Sentinel Platform (orchestration repo)

This orchestration layout coordinates Aureus and OpenClaw integration: contracts, bridge, tests, and CI.

Structure:
- `docs/` architecture and runbooks
- `contracts/v1/` JSON Schemas (contract-first fixtures)
- `bridge/` gateway adapter and policy client
- `tests/` contract and e2e tests
- `ci/` CI checks and evidence gates

Use this repo as the workspace for implementing Week 1 deliverables.
